## Introduction

Authoring and loading RDF data is a fundamental skill in working with SPARQL and semantic web technologies. This lesson 
will cover how to write RDF triples in Turtle format, understand default IRI and literal values, work with different 
datatypes, load triples into named graphs, create and manage datasets, and perform bulk loading of RDF data.
These skills are essential for building and managing RDF datasets that can be queried using SPARQL.

## Sample RDF Data

Let's start by creating a sample RDF dataset about books and authors. We'll use this data throughout the lesson to 
demonstrate various concepts.

```turtle
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .

ex:Book1 rdf:type ex:Book ;
    ex:title "The Great Gatsby" ;
    ex:author ex:Author1 ;
    ex:publicationDate "1925-04-10"^^xsd:date ;
    ex:pageCount 180 .

ex:Author1 rdf:type ex:Author ;
    ex:name "F. Scott Fitzgerald" ;
    ex:birthDate "1896-09-24"^^xsd:date ;
    ex:nationality "American" .

ex:Book2 rdf:type ex:Book ;
    ex:title "To Kill a Mockingbird" ;
    ex:author ex:Author2 ;
    ex:publicationDate "1960-07-11"^^xsd:date ;
    ex:pageCount 281 .

ex:Author2 rdf:type ex:Author ;
    ex:name "Harper Lee" ;
    ex:birthDate "1926-04-28"^^xsd:date ;
    ex:nationality "American" .
```

## Writing RDF Triples (Turtle Format)

Turtle (Terse RDF Triple Language) is a popular format for writing RDF triples. It's designed to be more readable
and compact than other RDF serializations. In the sample data above, we can see several key features of Turtle:

1. Prefixes: Defined at the top using `@prefix` to create shorthand for IRIs.
2. Subjects: Represented as IRIs (e.g., `ex:Book1`) or blank nodes.
3. Predicates: Represented as IRIs (e.g., `rdf:type`, `ex:title`).
4. Objects: Can be IRIs, literals, or blank nodes.
5. Semicolons (`;`): Used to separate multiple predicate-object pairs for the same subject.
6. Periods (`.`): Used to end a set of triples about a subject.

## Default IRI and Literal Values

In Turtle, there are some default assumptions for IRI and literal values:

1. Strings without a datatype are assumed to be of type `xsd:string`.
2. Numbers without a datatype are assumed to be `xsd:integer` or `xsd:decimal`.
3. IRIs can be written in full `<http://example.org/Book1>` or using prefixes `ex:Book1`.

## Datatypes in RDF

RDF supports various datatypes, primarily from the XML Schema Definition (XSD) namespace. Some common datatypes include:

1. `xsd:string`: For text values (default for untyped literals).
2. `xsd:integer`: For whole numbers.
3. `xsd:decimal`: For decimal numbers.
4. `xsd:date`: For date values.
5. `xsd:dateTime`: For date and time values.
6. `xsd:boolean`: For true/false values.

In our sample data, we use `xsd:date` for birth and publication dates, and implicit `xsd:integer` for page counts.

## Loading Triples into Apache Jena Fuseki

To load this data into Apache Jena Fuseki, follow these steps:

1. Save the Turtle data into a file, e.g., `books.ttl`.
2. Access the Fuseki web interface (typically at `http://localhost:3030`).
3. Create a new dataset, e.g., "books".
4. Go to the "add data" tab for your dataset.
5. Choose the file `books.ttl` and upload it.
6. Select the graph to load the data into (or use the default graph).

## Loading Triples into a Named Graph with LOAD

You can also load triples into a named graph using the SPARQL LOAD command. Here's an example:

```sparql
LOAD <file:///path/to/books.ttl> INTO GRAPH <http://example.org/books>
```

This command loads the triples from the `books.ttl` file into a named graph with the IRI `http://example.org/books`.

## Creating and Managing Datasets

In Fuseki, you can create and manage datasets through the web interface:

1. To create a dataset, use the "add new dataset" button on the homepage.
2. Choose a name and type (e.g., persistent, in-memory) for your dataset.
3. To manage a dataset, select it from the homepage to view options for querying, updating, and managing data.

## Bulk Loading of RDF Data

For large datasets, bulk loading is more efficient than using the web interface. With Fuseki, you can use the command
line tools for bulk loading:

1. Stop the Fuseki server.
2. Use the `tdbloader` command to load data:

```bash
tdbloader --loc=/path/to/fuseki/databases/books /path/to/large-dataset.ttl
```

3. Restart the Fuseki server.

## SPARQL Query Examples

Now that we have loaded our data, let's try some SPARQL queries:

1. Query to get all books and their titles:

```sparql
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?book ?title
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type ex:Book ;
        ex:title ?title .
}
```

2. Query to get authors born before 1900:

```sparql
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?authorName ?birthDate
WHERE {
  ?author rdf:type ex:Author ;
          ex:name ?authorName ;
          ex:birthDate ?birthDate .
  FILTER (?birthDate < "1900-01-01"^^xsd:date)
}
```

These queries demonstrate how to use the prefixes we defined, query for specific types of entities, and use FILTER to
compare date values.

## Exercise

Create a SPARQL query that returns the titles of books published after 1950, along with their authors' names. Order the
results by the book's publication date.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

```sparql
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?title ?authorName ?publicationDate
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type ex:Book ;
        ex:title ?title ;
        ex:author ?author ;
        ex:publicationDate ?publicationDate .
  ?author ex:name ?authorName .
  FILTER (?publicationDate > "1950-01-01"^^xsd:date)
}
ORDER BY ?publicationDate
```

This query will return "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee, published on 1960-07-11.
</details>

By mastering these concepts and techniques, you'll be well-equipped to author, load, and manage RDF data for your SPARQL
queries and semantic web applications.
