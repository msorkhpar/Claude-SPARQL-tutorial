# 4. Basic SPARQL Queries

## Introduction

SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is a powerful query language for RDF (Resource Description Framework) data. In this lesson, we'll cover the fundamentals of SPARQL queries, including SELECT statements, basic graph patterns, filtering, pagination, and sorting results. These concepts form the foundation for querying and extracting information from RDF datasets.

## Sample RDF Data

Let's start by creating a sample RDF dataset about books and authors. We'll use this data throughout our examples.

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/bookstore/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

:book1 rdf:type :Book ;
    :title "The Great Gatsby" ;
    :author :author1 ;
    :publicationYear "1925"^^xsd:integer ;
    :price "12.99"^^xsd:decimal .

:book2 rdf:type :Book ;
    :title "To Kill a Mockingbird" ;
    :author :author2 ;
    :publicationYear "1960"^^xsd:integer ;
    :price "14.99"^^xsd:decimal .

:book3 rdf:type :Book ;
    :title "1984" ;
    :author :author3 ;
    :publicationYear "1949"^^xsd:integer ;
    :price "11.99"^^xsd:decimal .

:author1 rdf:type :Author ;
    :name "F. Scott Fitzgerald" ;
    :birthYear "1896"^^xsd:integer .

:author2 rdf:type :Author ;
    :name "Harper Lee" ;
    :birthYear "1926"^^xsd:integer .

:author3 rdf:type :Author ;
    :name "George Orwell" ;
    :birthYear "1903"^^xsd:integer .
```

## Loading Data into Apache Jena Fuseki

To load this data into Apache Jena Fuseki:

1. Save the above RDF data in Turtle format to a file named `bookstore.ttl`.
2. Open the Fuseki web interface (usually at `http://localhost:3030`).
3. Create a new dataset named "bookstore" if it doesn't exist.
4. Go to the "upload data" tab for the "bookstore" dataset.
5. Choose the `bookstore.ttl` file and upload it.

## SELECT Queries and Basic Graph Patterns

SPARQL SELECT queries allow us to extract specific information from our RDF data. Let's start with a simple query to retrieve all books and their titles.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore/>

SELECT ?book ?title
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Book ;
        :title ?title .
}
```

This query does the following:
- The `PREFIX` declaration defines a shorthand for our namespace.
- `SELECT ?book ?title` specifies the variables we want in our result.
- The `WHERE` clause contains a basic graph pattern that matches all resources of type `:Book` and their titles.

Running this query will return:

```
| book  | title                   |
|-------|-------------------------|
| :book1| "The Great Gatsby"      |
| :book2| "To Kill a Mockingbird" |
| :book3| "1984"                  |
```

## FILTER Operations

We can use FILTER to apply conditions to our results. Let's find books published after 1950:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore/>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?title ?year
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Book ;
        :title ?title ;
        :publicationYear ?year .
  FILTER (?year > 1950)
}
```

This query introduces:
- A FILTER clause that only includes books with a publication year after 1950.
- The use of comparison operators (`>` in this case).

Result:

```
| book  | title                   | year |
|-------|-------------------------|------|
| :book2| "To Kill a Mockingbird" | 1960 |
```

We can also use logical operators. Let's find books published between 1940 and 1950:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore/>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?title ?year
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Book ;
        :title ?title ;
        :publicationYear ?year .
  FILTER (?year >= 1940 && ?year <= 1950)
}
```

This query demonstrates the use of the logical AND operator (`&&`).

Result:

```
| book  | title | year |
|-------|-------|------|
| :book3| "1984"| 1949 |
```

## LIMIT and OFFSET

LIMIT and OFFSET are useful for pagination. Let's retrieve books, but limit the results to 2 at a time:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore/>

SELECT ?book ?title
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Book ;
        :title ?title .
}
LIMIT 2
```

This will return only the first two results. To get the next page, we can use OFFSET:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore/>

SELECT ?book ?title
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Book ;
        :title ?title .
}
LIMIT 2
OFFSET 2
```

This will skip the first two results and return the next two (in this case, just one more book).

## ORDER BY

ORDER BY allows us to sort our results. Let's sort books by their publication year:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore/>

SELECT ?book ?title ?year
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Book ;
        :title ?title ;
        :publicationYear ?year .
}
ORDER BY ?year
```

This will return the books sorted by year in ascending order. To sort in descending order, use `ORDER BY DESC(?year)`.

## Practice Exercise

Now it's your turn! Write a SPARQL query that:

1. Retrieves all books with their titles and prices.
2. Filters for books that cost less than 13.00.
3. Orders the results by price in descending order.
4. Limits the output to the top 2 most expensive books under 13.00.

Try writing this query yourself before looking at the solution below.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore/>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?book ?title ?price
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Book ;
        :title ?title ;
        :price ?price .
  FILTER (?price < 13.00)
}
ORDER BY DESC(?price)
LIMIT 2
```

This query combines all the concepts we've learned: SELECT, WHERE, FILTER, ORDER BY, and LIMIT.

This concludes our lesson on basic SPARQL queries. Practice writing different queries to become more comfortable with these fundamental concepts.
