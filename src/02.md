# 2. Setting Up the Environment: Apache Jena Fuseki

Jupyter Notebook file of this section [2.ipynb](2.ipynb).
Do not forget to run jupyter server using provided compose file.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Introduction

Apache Jena Fuseki is a powerful SPARQL server that provides a robust environment for working with RDF data and 
executing SPARQL queries. It's an essential tool for developers and data scientists working with semantic web 
technologies. In this lesson, we'll learn how to set up Fuseki using Docker, which simplifies the installation process 
and makes it easy to manage.

## Setting Up Apache Jena Fuseki using Docker

Docker provides a convenient way to run Fuseki without worrying about complex installation procedures or dependencies.
We'll use the official Fuseki Docker image to get our environment up and running quickly.

### Step 1: Install Docker

First, ensure that Docker is installed on your system. You can download and install Docker from the official
website: https://www.docker.com/get-started

### Step 2: Pull the Fuseki Docker Image

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to pull the latest Fuseki Docker image:

```bash
docker pull stain/jena-fuseki
```

This command downloads the Fuseki image to your local Docker environment.

### Step 3: Run the Fuseki Container

Now, let's run the Fuseki container with some basic configuration:

```bash
docker run -p 3030:3030 -e ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin --name fuseki -d stain/jena-fuseki
```

This command does the following:
- `-p 3030:3030`: Maps port 3030 from the container to your host machine.
- `-e ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin`: Sets the admin password to "admin".
- `--name fuseki`: Names the container "fuseki" for easy reference.
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).

### Step 4: Verify Fuseki is Running

Check if the Fuseki container is running with:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see the Fuseki container in the list of running containers.

## Creating a New Quad Store

To create a new quad store (or dataset) in Fuseki:

1. Access the Fuseki web interface (explained in a later section).
2. Click on "manage datasets" in the navigation menu.
3. In the "Create new dataset" section, enter a name for your dataset (e.g., "mydata").
4. Select "Quad Store" as the dataset type.
5. Click "Create dataset".

## Basic Docker Commands for Managing Fuseki

Here are some essential Docker commands for managing your Fuseki container:

1. Stop the Fuseki container:
   ```bash
   docker stop fuseki
   ```

2. Start a stopped Fuseki container:
   ```bash
   docker start fuseki
   ```

3. Restart the Fuseki container:
   ```bash
   docker restart fuseki
   ```

4. Remove the Fuseki container (warning: this will delete all data in the container):
   ```bash
   docker rm fuseki
   ```

5. View Fuseki logs:
   ```bash
   docker logs fuseki
   ```

## Accessing the Fuseki Web Interface

To access the Fuseki web interface:

1. Open a web browser.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3030`.
3. You'll be prompted to log in. Use the following credentials:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: admin (or whatever password you set in the `docker run` command)

From the web interface, you can:
- Manage datasets
- Upload data
- Execute SPARQL queries
- Configure Fuseki settings

## Exercise

Now that you've set up Fuseki, let's practice with a small exercise:

1. Create a new dataset named "bookstore" in Fuseki.
2. Using the Fuseki web interface, upload the following RDF data to the "bookstore" dataset:

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/bookstore/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

:book1 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "The Great Gatsby" ;
       :author "F. Scott Fitzgerald" ;
       :year 1925 .

:book2 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "To Kill a Mockingbird" ;
       :author "Harper Lee" ;
       :year 1960 .
```

3. Execute a SPARQL query to retrieve all books and their titles.

Hint: Your SPARQL query should look something like this:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?book ?title
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Book ;
        :title ?title .
}
```

This exercise will help you practice creating a dataset, uploading data, and running a basic SPARQL query using the
Fuseki web interface.

By completing this lesson and exercise, you should now have a working Fuseki environment set up using Docker, and be
familiar with basic operations for managing the Fuseki container and interacting with the web interface.
