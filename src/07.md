# 7. SPARQL Lesson: Aggregation and Grouping

## Introduction

Aggregation and grouping are essential features in SPARQL that allow you to perform calculations on sets of data and 
organize results into meaningful groups. These operations are crucial for data analysis, summarization, and generating
insightful reports from RDF datasets. In this lesson, we'll explore various aggregate functions, grouping mechanisms,
and related clauses that enable powerful data manipulation in SPARQL queries.

## Sample RDF Data

Let's start by creating a sample RDF dataset about books and their sales. We'll use this data to demonstrate aggregation
and grouping concepts.

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/bookstore#> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

:book1 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "The Great Gatsby" ;
       :author "F. Scott Fitzgerald" ;
       :genre "Fiction" ;
       :price 12.99 ;
       :salesCount 1000 .

:book2 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "To Kill a Mockingbird" ;
       :author "Harper Lee" ;
       :genre "Fiction" ;
       :price 10.99 ;
       :salesCount 1500 .

:book3 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "1984" ;
       :author "George Orwell" ;
       :genre "Science Fiction" ;
       :price 9.99 ;
       :salesCount 2000 .

:book4 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "Pride and Prejudice" ;
       :author "Jane Austen" ;
       :genre "Romance" ;
       :price 8.99 ;
       :salesCount 1800 .

:book5 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "The Hobbit" ;
       :author "J.R.R. Tolkien" ;
       :genre "Fantasy" ;
       :price 11.99 ;
       :salesCount 2500 .
```

## Loading Data into Apache Jena Fuseki

To load this data into Apache Jena Fuseki:

1. Save the above RDF data in Turtle format to a file named `bookstore.ttl`.
2. Open the Fuseki web interface (usually at `http://localhost:3030`).
3. Create a new dataset named "bookstore" if it doesn't exist.
4. Go to the "upload data" tab for the "bookstore" dataset.
5. Choose the `bookstore.ttl` file and upload it.

## SPARQL Queries Demonstrating Aggregation and Grouping

Let's explore various aggregation and grouping concepts using SPARQL queries.

### 1. Aggregate Functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore#>

SELECT 
  (COUNT(?book) AS ?totalBooks)
  (SUM(?sales) AS ?totalSales)
  (AVG(?price) AS ?averagePrice)
  (MIN(?price) AS ?lowestPrice)
  (MAX(?price) AS ?highestPrice)
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Book ;
        :price ?price ;
        :salesCount ?sales .
}
```

This query demonstrates the use of various aggregate functions:
- `COUNT`: Counts the number of books
- `SUM`: Calculates the total sales across all books
- `AVG`: Computes the average price of books
- `MIN`: Finds the lowest book price
- `MAX`: Finds the highest book price

### 2. GROUP BY: Grouping Results

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore#>

SELECT ?genre (COUNT(?book) AS ?bookCount) (AVG(?price) AS ?averagePrice)
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Book ;
        :genre ?genre ;
        :price ?price .
}
GROUP BY ?genre
```

This query groups books by genre and calculates the count of books and average price for each genre.

### 3. HAVING: Filtering Grouped Results

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore#>

SELECT ?genre (COUNT(?book) AS ?bookCount) (AVG(?price) AS ?averagePrice)
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Book ;
        :genre ?genre ;
        :price ?price .
}
GROUP BY ?genre
HAVING (COUNT(?book) > 1)
```

This query is similar to the previous one but uses the `HAVING` clause to filter out genres with only one book.

### 4. GROUP_CONCAT: Concatenating Grouped Values

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore#>

SELECT ?genre (GROUP_CONCAT(?title; separator=", ") AS ?books)
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Book ;
        :genre ?genre ;
        :title ?title .
}
GROUP BY ?genre
```

This query demonstrates the use of `GROUP_CONCAT` to create a comma-separated list of book titles for each genre.

### 5. SAMPLE: Selecting a Single Value from a Group

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore#>

SELECT ?genre (SAMPLE(?title) AS ?sampleBook) (AVG(?price) AS ?averagePrice)
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Book ;
        :genre ?genre ;
        :title ?title ;
        :price ?price .
}
GROUP BY ?genre
```

This query uses the `SAMPLE` function to select a random book title from each genre, along with the average price.

## Explanation of Queries and Results

1. The first query provides an overview of the entire book collection, showing total books, total sales, average price, and price range.

2. The second query groups books by genre, allowing us to see how many books are in each genre and their average prices.

3. The third query builds on the second but filters out genres with only one book, demonstrating how `HAVING` can be used to filter grouped results.

4. The fourth query showcases `GROUP_CONCAT`, which is useful for creating lists of values within each group. Here, we get a list of book titles for each genre.

5. The last query demonstrates `SAMPLE`, which can be useful when you need to select a representative value from each group without caring which specific value is chosen.

These queries illustrate how aggregation and grouping can be used to summarize and analyze data in various ways, from 
simple counting and averaging to more complex grouping and filtering operations.

## Exercise

Now it's your turn to practice! Write a SPARQL query that does the following:

1. Groups books by author
2. Calculates the total sales (hint: use `SUM` on the `salesCount`)
3. Finds the highest priced book for each author (hint: use `MAX`)
4. Only includes authors with total sales over 2000
5. Orders the results by total sales in descending order

Try to write this query yourself, and then compare your solution to the one provided below.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore#>

SELECT ?author (SUM(?sales) AS ?totalSales) (MAX(?price) AS ?highestPrice)
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type :Book ;
        :author ?author ;
        :salesCount ?sales ;
        :price ?price .
}
GROUP BY ?author
HAVING (SUM(?sales) > 2000)
ORDER BY DESC(?totalSales)
```

This query demonstrates the combination of grouping, aggregation, filtering with `HAVING`, and ordering, providing a 
comprehensive view of author performance in terms of sales and pricing.

By mastering these aggregation and grouping techniques, you'll be able to extract valuable insights from RDF data 
using SPARQL. Practice with different combinations of these functions and clauses to become proficient in data 
analysis with SPARQL.
