# 14. Federated Queries in SPARQL

## Introduction

Federated queries in SPARQL are a powerful feature that allows you to retrieve and combine data from multiple SPARQL endpoints in a single query. This capability is crucial for integrating diverse datasets across the Semantic Web, enabling more comprehensive and insightful data analysis.

The importance of federated queries lies in their ability to:
1. Access distributed data sources
2. Combine local and remote data seamlessly
3. Enrich knowledge graphs with external information
4. Enable cross-domain data integration

In this lesson, we'll explore the concepts and techniques of federated querying in SPARQL, with a focus on the SERVICE keyword, handling remote endpoints, and performance considerations.

## Sample RDF Data

Let's start by setting up some sample RDF data that we'll use for our local queries. We'll create a small dataset about books and authors.

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/books/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

:book1 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "The Great Gatsby" ;
       :author :author1 ;
       :publicationYear "1925"^^xsd:integer .

:book2 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "To Kill a Mockingbird" ;
       :author :author2 ;
       :publicationYear "1960"^^xsd:integer .

:author1 rdf:type :Author ;
         :name "F. Scott Fitzgerald" .

:author2 rdf:type :Author ;
         :name "Harper Lee" .
```

## Loading Data into Apache Jena Fuseki

To load this data into Apache Jena Fuseki:

1. Save the above RDF data in a file named `books.ttl`.
2. Access the Fuseki web interface (usually at `http://localhost:3030`).
3. Create a new dataset named "books" if it doesn't exist.
4. Go to the "upload data" tab for the "books" dataset.
5. Choose the `books.ttl` file and upload it.

## Federated Queries with the SERVICE Keyword

The SERVICE keyword in SPARQL allows you to query remote SPARQL endpoints within your local query. Let's look at an example that combines our local data with data from DBpedia.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>
PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
PREFIX dbp: <http://dbpedia.org/property/>

SELECT ?bookTitle ?authorName ?birthDate
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?bookTitle ;
        :author ?author .
  ?author :name ?authorName .
  
  SERVICE <http://dbpedia.org/sparql> {
    ?dbpediaAuthor rdfs:label ?authorName@en ;
                   dbo:birthDate ?birthDate .
  }
}
```

This query does the following:
1. It retrieves book titles and author names from our local dataset.
2. It then uses the SERVICE keyword to query DBpedia's SPARQL endpoint.
3. In the DBpedia query, it looks for authors with matching names and retrieves their birth dates.

When executed, this query will return book titles from our local dataset along with the corresponding author's birth date from DBpedia.

## Combining Local and Remote Data

The previous example demonstrated how to combine local and remote data. Here's another example that enriches our local book data with genre information from DBpedia:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>
PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
PREFIX dbp: <http://dbpedia.org/property/>

SELECT ?bookTitle ?genre
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?bookTitle .
  
  SERVICE <http://dbpedia.org/sparql> {
    ?dbpediaBook rdf:type dbo:Book ;
                 rdfs:label ?bookTitle@en ;
                 dbo:literaryGenre ?genreResource .
    ?genreResource rdfs:label ?genre .
    FILTER(LANG(?genre) = "en")
  }
}
```

This query retrieves genre information for our local books from DBpedia, enriching our local knowledge graph.

## Handling Endpoint Failures and Timeouts

When working with remote endpoints, it's important to handle potential failures or timeouts. SPARQL provides the SILENT keyword to gracefully handle such situations:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>
PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

SELECT ?bookTitle ?authorName ?birthDate
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?bookTitle ;
        :author ?author .
  ?author :name ?authorName .
  
  OPTIONAL {
    SERVICE SILENT <http://dbpedia.org/sparql> {
      ?dbpediaAuthor rdfs:label ?authorName@en ;
                     dbo:birthDate ?birthDate .
    }
  }
}
```

In this query, the SILENT keyword ensures that the query doesn't fail if the DBpedia endpoint is unavailable. Instead, it will return results from the local dataset and leave the ?birthDate variable unbound for those cases.

## Performance Considerations in Federated Queries

When using federated queries, consider the following performance tips:

1. Minimize the amount of data transferred from remote endpoints.
2. Use FILTER clauses in the SERVICE block to reduce result sets.
3. Consider using LIMIT to restrict the number of results from remote endpoints.
4. Be mindful of the load you're placing on public endpoints.

Here's an example incorporating some of these considerations:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>
PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

SELECT ?bookTitle ?authorName ?birthDate
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?bookTitle ;
        :author ?author .
  ?author :name ?authorName .
  
  SERVICE <http://dbpedia.org/sparql> {
    ?dbpediaAuthor rdfs:label ?authorName@en ;
                   dbo:birthDate ?birthDate .
    FILTER(LANG(?authorName) = "en")
    FILTER(?birthDate < "1900-01-01"^^xsd:date)
  }
}
LIMIT 10
```

This query filters for authors born before 1900 and limits the results to 10, reducing the load on both the local and remote endpoints.

## Knowledge Graph Enrichment through Federated Queries

Federated queries can be used to enrich your local knowledge graph with data from external sources. Here's an example that adds information about an author's notable works to our local dataset:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>
PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>

CONSTRUCT {
  ?author :notableWork ?notableWork .
}
WHERE {
  ?author :name ?authorName .
  
  SERVICE <http://dbpedia.org/sparql> {
    ?dbpediaAuthor rdfs:label ?authorName@en ;
                   dbo:notableWork ?notableWork .
    FILTER(LANG(?notableWork) = "en")
  }
}
```

This CONSTRUCT query will create new triples in our local graph, adding information about notable works for each author found in DBpedia.

## Exercise

Now it's your turn to practice! Write a federated SPARQL query that does the following:

1. Retrieves all books from your local dataset.
2. For each book, query DBpedia to find the author's birth place.
3. Return the book title, author name, and birth place.
4. Handle potential endpoint failures gracefully.
5. Limit the results to 5 books.

Try to implement this query and test it against your local Fuseki endpoint and DBpedia. Remember to consider performance and error handling in your solution.

This exercise will help you practice combining local and remote data, handling endpoint failures, and managing query performance in federated SPARQL queries.
