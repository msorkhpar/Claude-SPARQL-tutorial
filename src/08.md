# 8. SPARQL Property Paths

## Introduction

Property paths in SPARQL are a powerful feature that allows you to express complex relationships between resources in a
concise manner. They enable you to traverse the RDF graph in various ways, making it easier to query and explore 
connected data. Property paths are particularly useful when dealing with hierarchical structures, transitive 
relationships, or when you need to find paths of arbitrary length between resources.

In this lesson, we'll explore different types of property paths and how to use them effectively in SPARQL queries.

## Sample RDF Data

Let's start by creating a sample RDF dataset that we'll use throughout this lesson. This dataset represents a simple 
family tree and organizational structure.

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/> .
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

:Alice a foaf:Person ;
    foaf:name "Alice" ;
    :hasChild :Bob, :Carol ;
    :worksFor :CompanyA .

:Bob a foaf:Person ;
    foaf:name "Bob" ;
    :hasChild :David ;
    :worksFor :DepartmentX .

:Carol a foaf:Person ;
    foaf:name "Carol" ;
    :hasChild :Eve ;
    :worksFor :DepartmentY .

:David a foaf:Person ;
    foaf:name "David" ;
    :worksFor :TeamAlpha .

:Eve a foaf:Person ;
    foaf:name "Eve" ;
    :worksFor :TeamBeta .

:CompanyA :hasDepartment :DepartmentX, :DepartmentY .
:DepartmentX :hasTeam :TeamAlpha .
:DepartmentY :hasTeam :TeamBeta .
```

## Loading Data into Apache Jena Fuseki

To load this data into Apache Jena Fuseki:

1. Save the above RDF data in Turtle format to a file named `family_org.ttl`.
2. Open the Fuseki web interface (usually at `http://localhost:3030`).
3. Create a new dataset named "family_org" if it doesn't exist.
4. Go to the "upload data" tab for the "family_org" dataset.
5. Choose the `family_org.ttl` file and upload it.

Now that we have our data loaded, let's explore different types of property paths.

## 1. Simple Property Paths: Direct Relationships

Simple property paths represent direct relationships between resources. They are the most basic form of property paths
and are written as a single predicate.

**Example Query:**
```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

SELECT ?person ?child
WHERE {
    ?person :hasChild ?child .
}
```

This query finds all direct parent-child relationships in our dataset.

**Explanation:** The simple property path `:hasChild` matches direct relationships between parents and their children.

## 2. Inverse Paths: Traversing Predicates Backwards

Inverse paths allow you to traverse a relationship in the opposite direction. They are denoted by the `^` symbol before
the predicate.

**Example Query:**
```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

SELECT ?person ?parent
WHERE {
    ?person ^:hasChild ?parent .
}
```

This query finds all child-parent relationships by traversing the `:hasChild` predicate backwards.

**Explanation:** The `^:hasChild` inverse path allows us to find parents from their children, even though our data only 
explicitly states children from parents.

## 3. Sequence Paths: Chaining Multiple Predicates

Sequence paths allow you to chain multiple predicates together, creating a path through the graph. They are denoted
by the `/` symbol between predicates.

**Example Query:**
```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

SELECT ?person ?team
WHERE {
    ?person :worksFor/:hasTeam ?team .
}
```

This query finds people and the teams they work for, even if they're not directly associated with the team in the data.

**Explanation:** The sequence path `:worksFor/:hasTeam` first follows the `:worksFor` predicate and then the `:hasTeam`
predicate, allowing us to connect people to their teams through their departments.

## 4. Alternative Paths: Matching One of Several Predicates

Alternative paths allow you to match any one of several predicates. They are denoted by the `|` symbol between predicates.

**Example Query:**
```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

SELECT ?person ?relation
WHERE {
    :Alice (:hasChild|:worksFor) ?relation .
}
```

This query finds both children and workplaces of Alice.

**Explanation:** The alternative path `(:hasChild|:worksFor)` matches either the `:hasChild` predicate or the 
`:worksFor` predicate, allowing us to find different types of relationships in a single query.

## 5. Zero or More Paths: Kleene Star Operator

The Kleene star operator (`*`) allows you to match a path of any length, including zero. This is useful for traversing
hierarchical structures of unknown depth.

**Example Query:**
```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

SELECT ?person ?descendant
WHERE {
    :Alice :hasChild* ?descendant .
    ?descendant a foaf:Person .
}
```

This query finds all descendants of Alice, including her children, grandchildren, and so on.

**Explanation:** The `:hasChild*` path matches zero or more occurrences of the `:hasChild` predicate, allowing us to 
traverse the family tree to any depth.

## 6. One or More Paths: Kleene Plus Operator

The Kleene plus operator (`+`) is similar to the star operator, but it requires at least one occurrence of the predicate.

**Example Query:**
```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

SELECT ?organization ?subOrg
WHERE {
    :CompanyA (:hasDepartment/:hasTeam)+ ?subOrg .
}
```

This query finds all sub-organizations (departments and teams) of CompanyA, excluding CompanyA itself.

**Explanation:** The `(:hasDepartment/:hasTeam)+` path matches one or more occurrences of the sequence 
`:hasDepartment/:hasTeam`, allowing us to find all levels of the organizational hierarchy below CompanyA.

## 7. Negated Property Sets: Excluding Specific Predicates

Negated property sets allow you to match any predicate except those specified. They are denoted by the `!` symbol and 
parentheses.

**Example Query:**
```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

SELECT ?person ?relation
WHERE {
    ?person !(:hasChild|foaf:name) ?relation .
}
```

This query finds all relationships for people except for their children or names.

**Explanation:** The `!(

:hasChild|foaf:name)` path matches any predicate except `:hasChild` and `foaf:name`, allowing us to find other types of
relationships in the data.

## Practice Exercise

Now that we've covered various types of property paths, let's try a more complex query that combines multiple concepts.

**Challenge:** Write a SPARQL query that finds all of Alice's descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) and their 
work affiliations (company, department, or team), using property paths to traverse both the family tree and the 
organizational structure.

Here's a template to get you started:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

SELECT ?descendant ?descendantName ?workAffiliation
WHERE {
    :Alice :hasChild+ ?descendant .
    ?descendant foaf:name ?descendantName .
    ?descendant :worksFor/:hasDepartment* ?workAffiliation .
}
```

Try to modify and expand this query to get the desired results. Consider how you can use different property path 
types to navigate the graph efficiently.

This exercise will help you practice combining various property path techniques to extract complex relationships 
from the RDF graph.
