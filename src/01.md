# 1. Introduction to RDF and SPARQL

## 1. Brief Introduction

Resource Description Framework (RDF) and SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) are fundamental technologies 
in the Semantic Web stack. RDF provides a flexible way to represent data in a graph structure, while SPARQL allows us 
to query and manipulate this data. Understanding these concepts is crucial for working with linked data and semantic
web applications.

## 2. RDF Basics and Graph Structure

RDF (Resource Description Framework) is a standard model for data interchange on the Web.
It extends the linking structure of the Web by using URIs to name the relationship between things as well as the two 
ends of the link (this is usually referred to as a "triple"). This linking structure forms a directed, labeled graph,
where the edges represent the named link between two resources, represented by the graph nodes.

## 3. Types of Nodes in RDF

In RDF, there are three types of nodes:

1. **URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)**: These are used to identify resources uniquely. They can represent anything from web pages to abstract concepts.

2. **Literals**: These are used for values such as strings, numbers, and dates. They are the actual data in the RDF graph.

3. **Blank Nodes**: These are anonymous resources that are not given a global identifier. They are used when the identity of the resource is not important or is unknown.

## 4. Triples and Their Components

RDF data is represented as triples, each consisting of three components:

1. **Subject**: The resource being described (always a URI or blank node)
2. **Predicate**: The property or relationship (always a URI)
3. **Object**: The value of the property for the subject (can be a URI, blank node, or literal)

## 5. Introduction to SPARQL and Its Purpose

SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is the standard query language for RDF data. It allows you to:

- Retrieve and manipulate data stored in RDF format
- Perform complex joins of disparate databases in a single query
- Transform RDF data from one vocabulary to another

## 6. PREFIX and @prefix: Simplifying URIs in Queries

To make SPARQL queries more readable and manageable, we use PREFIX declarations. These allow us to use shortened forms
of URIs in our queries.

Now, let's dive into a practical example to demonstrate these concepts.

## Sample RDF Data

Here's a small RDF dataset about books and authors:

```turtle
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

ex:Book1 rdf:type ex:Book ;
    ex:title "1984" ;
    ex:author ex:GeorgeOrwell ;
    ex:publicationYear "1949"^^xsd:integer .

ex:Book2 rdf:type ex:Book ;
    ex:title "To Kill a Mockingbird" ;
    ex:author ex:HarperLee ;
    ex:publicationYear "1960"^^xsd:integer .

ex:GeorgeOrwell rdf:type ex:Author ;
    ex:name "George Orwell" .

ex:HarperLee rdf:type ex:Author ;
    ex:name "Harper Lee" .
```

## Loading Data into Apache Jena Fuseki

To load this data into Apache Jena Fuseki:

1. Save the above RDF data into a file named `books.ttl`.
2. In the Fuseki web interface, go to the "manage datasets" page.
3. Create a new dataset (if not already created) or select an existing one.
4. Click on "upload data" and select the `books.ttl` file.
5. Choose the "Turtle" format and click "Upload".

## SPARQL Queries

Now, let's write some SPARQL queries to demonstrate the concepts we've learned.

### Query 1: Retrieve all books and their titles

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/>

SELECT ?book ?title
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type ex:Book ;
        ex:title ?title .
}
```

This query will return:

```
-----------------------
| book     | title    |
=======================
| ex:Book1 | "1984"   |
| ex:Book2 | "To Kill a Mockingbird" |
-----------------------
```

Explanation:
- We use PREFIX to define shortcuts for URIs.
- The SELECT clause specifies the variables we want in our result.
- The WHERE clause defines the graph pattern to match against our RDF data.
- `?book rdf:type ex:Book` finds all resources of type "Book".
- `?book ex:title ?title` retrieves the title for each book.

### Query 2: Find books published after 1950 along with their authors

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?bookTitle ?authorName ?year
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type ex:Book ;
        ex:title ?bookTitle ;
        ex:author ?author ;
        ex:publicationYear ?year .
  ?author ex:name ?authorName .
  FILTER (?year > "1950"^^xsd:integer)
}
```

This query will return:

```
-------------------------------------------------------
| bookTitle                | authorName    | year     |
=======================================================
| "To Kill a Mockingbird"  | "Harper Lee"  | 1960     |
-------------------------------------------------------
```

Explanation:
- This query demonstrates joining information from multiple triples.
- We use the FILTER keyword to only include books published after 1950.
- The query links the book to its author and retrieves the author's name.

## Exercise

Write a SPARQL query to find all authors in the dataset along with the titles of their books. Order the results 
alphabetically by author name.

(You can check your answer by running the query in Fuseki and verifying the results.)

This lesson has introduced you to the basics of RDF and SPARQL, demonstrating how to represent data as triples and
how to query this data using SPARQL. Practice writing more queries to become comfortable with the syntax and
capabilities of SPARQL.
