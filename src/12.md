# 12. RDF Schema (RDFS)

## Introduction

RDF Schema (RDFS) is an extension of the basic RDF model that provides a vocabulary for describing classes and properties of RDF resources. It allows for the creation of more structured and semantically rich data models. RDFS is crucial in SPARQL as it enables more expressive queries and supports inferencing, which can reveal implicit relationships in the data.

## Sample RDF Data

Let's start by creating a sample RDF dataset that we'll use to demonstrate RDFS concepts. This dataset will represent a simple library catalog system.

```turtle
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix ex: <http://example.org/library/> .

# Classes
ex:Book rdfs:subClassOf ex:Item .
ex:Magazine rdfs:subClassOf ex:Item .
ex:Person rdf:type rdfs:Class .

# Properties
ex:author rdfs:domain ex:Book ;
          rdfs:range ex:Person .
ex:title rdfs:domain ex:Item ;
         rdfs:range rdfs:Literal .
ex:publicationYear rdfs:domain ex:Item ;
                   rdfs:range rdfs:Literal .

# Instances
ex:book1 rdf:type ex:Book ;
         ex:title "1984" ;
         ex:author ex:george_orwell ;
         ex:publicationYear "1949" .

ex:book2 rdf:type ex:Book ;
         ex:title "To Kill a Mockingbird" ;
         ex:author ex:harper_lee ;
         ex:publicationYear "1960" .

ex:magazine1 rdf:type ex:Magazine ;
             ex:title "National Geographic" ;
             ex:publicationYear "2023" .

ex:george_orwell rdf:type ex:Person .
ex:harper_lee rdf:type ex:Person .
```

## Loading Data into Apache Jena Fuseki

To load this data into Apache Jena Fuseki:

1. Save the above Turtle data into a file named `library.ttl`.
2. Access the Fuseki web interface (usually at `http://localhost:3030`).
3. Create a new dataset named "library" if it doesn't exist.
4. Go to the "upload data" tab for the "library" dataset.
5. Choose the `library.ttl` file and upload it.

## RDFS Classes and Properties

In our example, we've defined several RDFS classes and properties:

- Classes: `ex:Book`, `ex:Magazine`, `ex:Item`, `ex:Person`
- Properties: `ex:author`, `ex:title`, `ex:publicationYear`

### Query 1: Retrieve all classes

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/library/>

SELECT DISTINCT ?class
WHERE {
  { ?class rdf:type rdfs:Class }
  UNION
  { ?subclass rdfs:subClassOf ?class }
}
```

This query retrieves all classes defined in our schema, including those explicitly typed as `rdfs:Class` and those inferred from `rdfs:subClassOf` relationships.

## rdfs:subClassOf and rdfs:subPropertyOf Relationships

In our example, we've defined subclass relationships:
- `ex:Book rdfs:subClassOf ex:Item`
- `ex:Magazine rdfs:subClassOf ex:Item`

### Query 2: Retrieve class hierarchy

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/library/>

SELECT ?subclass ?superclass
WHERE {
  ?subclass rdfs:subClassOf ?superclass .
}
```

This query retrieves the class hierarchy defined in our schema.

## Domain and Range: rdfs:domain and rdfs:range

We've defined domains and ranges for our properties:
- `ex:author` has domain `ex:Book` and range `ex:Person`
- `ex:title` has domain `ex:Item` and range `rdfs:Literal`
- `ex:publicationYear` has domain `ex:Item` and range `rdfs:Literal`

### Query 3: Retrieve property domains and ranges

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/library/>

SELECT ?property ?domain ?range
WHERE {
  ?property rdfs:domain ?domain ;
            rdfs:range ?range .
}
```

This query retrieves the domains and ranges of all properties in our schema.

## Inferencing with RDFS: Implicit Triples

RDFS allows for inferencing, which can reveal implicit relationships in the data. For example, since `ex:Book` is a subclass of `ex:Item`, any instance of `ex:Book` is also implicitly an instance of `ex:Item`.

### Query 4: Retrieve all items (including inferred)

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/library/>

SELECT ?item ?type
WHERE {
  ?item rdf:type/rdfs:subClassOf* ex:Item .
  ?item rdf:type ?type .
}
```

This query retrieves all items, including those inferred through the subclass relationship. The `rdf:type/rdfs:subClassOf*` path expression allows for zero or more `rdfs:subClassOf` steps after the `rdf:type` step.

## Querying with RDFS Semantics

When querying with RDFS semantics, we can leverage the class and property hierarchies to write more expressive queries.

### Query 5: Find all creators (authors) of items

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/library/>

SELECT ?item ?creator
WHERE {
  ?item rdf:type/rdfs:subClassOf* ex:Item .
  ?item ?creatorProperty ?creator .
  ?creatorProperty rdfs:subPropertyOf* ex:author .
}
```

This query finds all creators of items, leveraging the RDFS semantics. It will return authors of books, and if we had defined other creator properties (e.g., `ex:editor` for magazines) as subproperties of `ex:author`, it would return those as well.

## Exercise

Create a SPARQL query that retrieves all items (books and magazines) published after the year 2000, along with their titles and publication years. Use RDFS inferencing to ensure you're capturing all relevant items.

<details>
<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/library/>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?item ?title ?year
WHERE {
  ?item rdf:type/rdfs:subClassOf* ex:Item ;
        ex:title ?title ;
        ex:publicationYear ?year .
  FILTER (xsd:integer(?year) > 2000)
}
ORDER BY ?year
```

This query uses RDFS inferencing to retrieve all items (including books and magazines), and then filters for those published after 2000. The results are ordered by publication year.

This lesson has covered the key concepts of RDF Schema (RDFS) and demonstrated how to use them in SPARQL queries. RDFS provides a powerful way to add structure and semantics to your RDF data, enabling more expressive queries and inferencing capabilities.
