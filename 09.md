# 9. SPARQL Result Formats and Query Forms

## Introduction

SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is a powerful query language for RDF (Resource Description Framework) data. One of its key features is the variety of query forms and result formats it supports. This lesson will cover the four main SPARQL query forms: SELECT, CONSTRUCT, ASK, and DESCRIBE, as well as the different result formats available for SPARQL queries.

Understanding these query forms and result formats is crucial for effectively working with RDF data and integrating SPARQL queries into various applications.

## Sample RDF Data

Let's start by creating a small RDF dataset about books and authors. We'll use this dataset to demonstrate the different query forms and result formats.

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/bookstore/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

:book1 rdf:type :Book ;
    :title "The Great Gatsby" ;
    :author :author1 ;
    :publicationYear "1925"^^xsd:integer ;
    :genre "Fiction" .

:book2 rdf:type :Book ;
    :title "To Kill a Mockingbird" ;
    :author :author2 ;
    :publicationYear "1960"^^xsd:integer ;
    :genre "Fiction" .

:book3 rdf:type :Book ;
    :title "A Brief History of Time" ;
    :author :author3 ;
    :publicationYear "1988"^^xsd:integer ;
    :genre "Non-fiction" .

:author1 rdf:type :Author ;
    :name "F. Scott Fitzgerald" ;
    :birthYear "1896"^^xsd:integer .

:author2 rdf:type :Author ;
    :name "Harper Lee" ;
    :birthYear "1926"^^xsd:integer .

:author3 rdf:type :Author ;
    :name "Stephen Hawking" ;
    :birthYear "1942"^^xsd:integer .
```

## Loading Data into Apache Jena Fuseki

To load this data into Apache Jena Fuseki:

1. Save the above RDF data in Turtle format to a file named `books.ttl`.
2. Open the Fuseki web interface (usually at `http://localhost:3030`).
3. Create a new dataset named "bookstore" if it doesn't exist.
4. Go to the "upload data" tab for the "bookstore" dataset.
5. Choose the `books.ttl` file and upload it to the dataset.

## SPARQL Query Forms

### 1. SELECT Queries: Returning Tabular Results

SELECT queries are used to retrieve specific data from the RDF graph in a tabular format.

Example query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore/>

SELECT ?book ?title ?author ?authorName
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book ;
        :title ?title ;
        :author ?author .
  ?author :name ?authorName .
}
```

This query returns a table with book URIs, titles, author URIs, and author names.

Explanation:
- The query matches all resources of type `:Book`.
- For each book, it retrieves the title and author.
- It then looks up the name of each author.
- The result is a table with four columns: ?book, ?title, ?author, and ?authorName.

### 2. CONSTRUCT Queries: Building New RDF Graphs

CONSTRUCT queries allow you to create new RDF triples based on the query results.

Example query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

CONSTRUCT {
  ?book rdfs:label ?bookLabel .
  ?author rdfs:label ?authorLabel .
}
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book ;
        :title ?title ;
        :author ?author .
  ?author :name ?authorName .
  BIND(CONCAT(?title, " by ", ?authorName) AS ?bookLabel)
  BIND(CONCAT("Author: ", ?authorName) AS ?authorLabel)
}
```

This query constructs new RDF triples with rdfs:label properties for books and authors.

Explanation:
- The WHERE clause retrieves book and author information.
- The CONSTRUCT clause creates new triples using the rdfs:label predicate.
- Book labels are created by concatenating the title and author name.
- Author labels are created by prefixing the author name with "Author: ".

### 3. ASK Queries: Boolean Existence Checks

ASK queries return a boolean (true/false) result indicating whether a specific pattern exists in the data.

Example query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore/>

ASK {
  ?book :genre "Non-fiction" .
}
```

This query checks if there are any books with the genre "Non-fiction".

Explanation:
- The query looks for any triple with the predicate `:genre` and the object "Non-fiction".
- It returns true if such a triple exists, and false otherwise.
- In our dataset, this query will return true because of the book "A Brief History of Time".

### 4. DESCRIBE Queries: Retrieving Related Triples

DESCRIBE queries return a set of triples that describe a resource or set of resources.

Example query:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/bookstore/>

DESCRIBE ?book
WHERE {
  ?book :genre "Fiction" .
}
```

This query retrieves all triples related to books in the "Fiction" genre.

Explanation:
- The WHERE clause identifies books with the "Fiction" genre.
- The DESCRIBE keyword returns all triples that have these books as the subject.
- The exact set of triples returned can vary depending on the SPARQL engine implementation.

## Result Formats

SPARQL results can be returned in various formats. The most common are:

1. XML (application/sparql-results+xml)
2. JSON (application/sparql-results+json)
3. CSV (text/csv)
4. TSV (text/tab-separated-values)

The format can be specified using content negotiation in HTTP requests. For example, to request JSON results:

```
Accept: application/sparql-results+json
```

In Fuseki's web interface, you can usually select the desired format from a dropdown menu.

Here's an example of how the SELECT query results might look in different formats:

1. XML:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<sparql xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/sparql-results#">
  <head>
    <variable name="book"/>
    <variable name="title"/>
    <variable name="author"/>
    <variable name="authorName"/>
  </head>
  <results>
    <result>
      <binding name="book"><uri>http://example.org/bookstore/book1</uri></binding>
      <binding name="title"><literal>The Great Gatsby</literal></binding>
      <binding name="author"><uri>http://example.org/bookstore/author1</uri></binding>
      <binding name="authorName"><literal>F. Scott Fitzgerald</literal></binding>
    </result>
    <!-- More results... -->
  </results>
</sparql>
```

2. JSON:
```json
{
  "head": {
    "vars": [ "book", "title", "author", "authorName" ]
  },
  "results": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "book": { "type": "uri", "value": "http://example.org/bookstore/book1" },
        "title": { "type": "literal", "value": "The Great Gatsby" },
        "author": { "type": "uri", "value": "http://example.org/bookstore/author1" },
        "authorName": { "type": "literal", "value": "F. Scott Fitzgerald" }
      },
      // More results...
    ]
  }
}
```

3. CSV:
```csv
book,title,author,authorName
http://example.org/bookstore/book1,The Great Gatsby,http://example.org/bookstore/author1,F. Scott Fitzgerald
http://example.org/bookstore/book2,To Kill a Mockingbird,http://example.org/bookstore/author2,Harper Lee
http://example.org/bookstore/book3,A Brief History of Time,http://example.org/bookstore/author3,Stephen Hawking
```

4. TSV:
```tsv
book	title	author	authorName
http://example.org/bookstore/book1	The Great Gatsby	http://example.org/bookstore/author1	F. Scott Fitzgerald
http://example.org/bookstore/book2	To Kill a Mockingbird	http://example.org/bookstore/author2	Harper Lee
http://example.org/bookstore/book3	A Brief History of Time	http://example.org/bookstore/author3	Stephen Hawking
```

## Practice Exercise

Now that you've learned about different SPARQL query forms and result formats, try this exercise:

1. Write a CONSTRUCT query that creates new triples representing a "reading list". For each book published before 1950, create a triple with the subject `:ReadingList`, the predicate `:includes`, and the book as the object.

2. Write an ASK query to check if there are any authors in the dataset born after 1930.

3. Write a SELECT query to find all books and their publication years, and request the results in JSON format. How would you modify your HTTP request to get these results in JSON?

Try these queries in the Fuseki interface and observe the results in different formats!
