# 13. RDF Containers and Collections in SPARQL

## Introduction

RDF Containers and Collections are essential concepts in RDF (Resource Description Framework) that allow for the representation of groups of resources. They provide different ways to model and query ordered and unordered sets of data. Understanding these concepts is crucial for effectively working with complex RDF data structures and writing efficient SPARQL queries.

In this lesson, we'll explore RDF Containers (rdf:Bag, rdf:Seq, rdf:Alt) and RDF Collections (rdf:List), learn how to declare and query them, and discuss the differences between the two.

## Sample RDF Data

Let's start by creating some sample RDF data that demonstrates the use of RDF Containers and Collections. We'll use a scenario of a library catalog to illustrate these concepts.

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/library/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

# RDF Containers
:PopularBooks a rdf:Bag ;
    rdf:_1 :Book1 ;
    rdf:_2 :Book2 ;
    rdf:_3 :Book3 .

:ReadingList a rdf:Seq ;
    rdf:_1 :Book2 ;
    rdf:_2 :Book1 ;
    rdf:_3 :Book3 .

:RecommendedBooks a rdf:Alt ;
    rdf:_1 :Book1 ;
    rdf:_2 :Book2 ;
    rdf:_3 :Book3 .

# RDF Collection
:FavoriteAuthors a rdf:List ;
    rdf:first "Jane Austen" ;
    rdf:rest [
        rdf:first "George Orwell" ;
        rdf:rest [
            rdf:first "Leo Tolstoy" ;
            rdf:rest rdf:nil
        ]
    ] .

# Book details
:Book1 rdfs:label "Pride and Prejudice" .
:Book2 rdfs:label "1984" .
:Book3 rdfs:label "War and Peace" .
```

## Loading Data into Apache Jena Fuseki

To load this data into Apache Jena Fuseki:

1. Save the above Turtle data into a file named `library.ttl`.
2. Access the Fuseki web interface (usually at `http://localhost:3030`).
3. Create a new dataset named "library" if it doesn't exist.
4. Go to the "upload data" tab for the "library" dataset.
5. Choose the `library.ttl` file and upload it.

## RDF Containers: rdf:Bag, rdf:Seq, rdf:Alt

RDF Containers are used to represent groups of things. There are three types of containers:

1. `rdf:Bag`: An unordered collection of resources or literals.
2. `rdf:Seq`: An ordered collection of resources or literals.
3. `rdf:Alt`: A collection of alternatives.

In our example, we've used all three types:
- `PopularBooks` is an `rdf:Bag`, representing an unordered list of popular books.
- `ReadingList` is an `rdf:Seq`, representing an ordered reading list.
- `RecommendedBooks` is an `rdf:Alt`, representing alternative book recommendations.

### Querying RDF Containers

To query RDF Containers, we need to handle the `rdf:_n` predicates. Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves all books from the `PopularBooks` bag:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/library/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?book ?title
WHERE {
  :PopularBooks ?predicate ?book .
  FILTER(STRSTARTS(STR(?predicate), STR(rdf:_)))
  ?book rdfs:label ?title .
}
```

This query does the following:
1. It matches all triples where `:PopularBooks` is the subject.
2. It filters the predicates to only include those that start with `rdf:_`.
3. It retrieves the label (title) of each book.

The result will show all books in the `PopularBooks` bag, but the order is not guaranteed.

## RDF Collections: rdf:List

RDF Collections, represented by `rdf:List`, provide a way to represent ordered groups of resources where the membership is closed (i.e., all members are explicitly specified).

In our example, `FavoriteAuthors` is an `rdf:List` containing a list of author names.

### Querying RDF Collections

Querying RDF Collections involves traversing the `rdf:first` and `rdf:rest` structure. Here's a SPARQL query that retrieves all authors from the `FavoriteAuthors` list:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/library/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?author
WHERE {
  :FavoriteAuthors rdf:rest*/rdf:first ?author .
}
ORDER BY ?author
```

This query uses property path expressions (`rdf:rest*`) to traverse the list structure, retrieving each `rdf:first` value (which represents an author name).

## Converting between Containers and Collections

Converting between Containers and Collections often requires custom SPARQL queries or external processing. Here's an example of how you might convert the `ReadingList` sequence to a collection:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/library/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

CONSTRUCT {
  :ReadingListCollection a rdf:List ;
    rdf:first ?firstBook ;
    rdf:rest ?rest .
  ?rest rdf:first ?secondBook ;
    rdf:rest ?rest2 .
  ?rest2 rdf:first ?thirdBook ;
    rdf:rest rdf:nil .
}
WHERE {
  :ReadingList rdf:_1 ?firstBook ;
               rdf:_2 ?secondBook ;
               rdf:_3 ?thirdBook .
  BIND(BNODE() AS ?rest)
  BIND(BNODE() AS ?rest2)
}
```

This CONSTRUCT query creates a new `rdf:List` structure from the `ReadingList` sequence. Note that this approach assumes a fixed number of items and would need to be adjusted for variable-length containers.

## Exercise

Create a SPARQL query that retrieves all books from the `RecommendedBooks` alternative list, along with their positions in the list. The result should be ordered by the position.

<summary>Click to see the solution</summary>

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/library/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?position ?title
WHERE {
  :RecommendedBooks ?predicate ?book .
  FILTER(STRSTARTS(STR(?predicate), STR(rdf:_)))
  BIND(REPLACE(STR(?predicate), STR(rdf:), "") AS ?posStr)
  BIND(xsd:integer(?posStr) AS ?position)
  ?book rdfs:label ?title .
}
ORDER BY ?position
```

This query:
1. Matches all triples where `:RecommendedBooks` is the subject.
2. Filters the predicates to only include those that start with `rdf:_`.
3. Extracts the position number from the predicate.
4. Retrieves the label (title) of each book.
5. Orders the results by position.
