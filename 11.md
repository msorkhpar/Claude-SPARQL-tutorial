# 11. Named Graphs and Graph Management in SPARQL

## Introduction

Named graphs are a crucial concept in RDF and SPARQL that allow for the organization and management of multiple sets of triples within a single RDF store. They provide a way to group related data, manage provenance, and perform operations on specific subsets of data. In this lesson, we'll explore how to create, query, and manage named graphs using SPARQL.

## Sample RDF Data

Let's start by creating some sample RDF data that we'll use throughout this lesson. We'll create three named graphs: one for books, one for authors, and one for publishers.

```turtle
# Default Graph
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix ex: <http://example.org/> .

# Books Graph
GRAPH <http://example.org/graphs/books> {
  ex:book1 rdf:type ex:Book ;
           ex:title "1984" ;
           ex:author ex:author1 ;
           ex:publisher ex:publisher1 .

  ex:book2 rdf:type ex:Book ;
           ex:title "To Kill a Mockingbird" ;
           ex:author ex:author2 ;
           ex:publisher ex:publisher2 .
}

# Authors Graph
GRAPH <http://example.org/graphs/authors> {
  ex:author1 rdf:type ex:Author ;
             ex:name "George Orwell" ;
             ex:birthYear "1903"^^xsd:integer .

  ex:author2 rdf:type ex:Author ;
             ex:name "Harper Lee" ;
             ex:birthYear "1926"^^xsd:integer .
}

# Publishers Graph
GRAPH <http://example.org/graphs/publishers> {
  ex:publisher1 rdf:type ex:Publisher ;
                ex:name "Secker & Warburg" ;
                ex:foundedYear "1935"^^xsd:integer .

  ex:publisher2 rdf:type ex:Publisher ;
                ex:name "J. B. Lippincott & Co." ;
                ex:foundedYear "1836"^^xsd:integer .
}
```

## Loading Data into Apache Jena Fuseki

To load this data into Apache Jena Fuseki, you can use the Fuseki web interface or the command-line tools. Here's how you can do it using the web interface:

1. Open the Fuseki web interface (usually at `http://localhost:3030`).
2. Select the dataset you want to use or create a new one.
3. Go to the "add data" tab.
4. Choose "upload data" and select the file containing the above Turtle data.
5. Click "upload" to load the data into Fuseki.

## Creating Named Graphs

In the sample data above, we've already created three named graphs using the `GRAPH` keyword. However, you can also create named graphs using SPARQL UPDATE operations. Here's an example:

```sparql
CREATE GRAPH <http://example.org/graphs/reviews>
```

This query creates an empty named graph for book reviews.

## Querying Named Graphs: FROM and FROM NAMED Clauses

To query specific named graphs, we use the `FROM` and `FROM NAMED` clauses. Here's an example that queries the books graph:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?title
FROM <http://example.org/graphs/books>
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type ex:Book ;
        ex:title ?title .
}
```

This query will return all books and their titles from the books graph.

To query multiple named graphs, you can use multiple `FROM` clauses or combine `FROM` and `FROM NAMED`:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?title ?authorName
FROM <http://example.org/graphs/books>
FROM NAMED <http://example.org/graphs/authors>
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type ex:Book ;
        ex:title ?title ;
        ex:author ?author .
  GRAPH <http://example.org/graphs/authors> {
    ?author ex:name ?authorName .
  }
}
```

This query combines data from the books graph and the authors graph to return books with their titles and author names.

## Working with Multiple Graphs

SPARQL allows you to work with multiple graphs simultaneously. Here's an example that queries all three of our graphs:

```sparql
SELECT ?book ?title ?authorName ?publisherName
FROM <http://example.org/graphs/books>
FROM NAMED <http://example.org/graphs/authors>
FROM NAMED <http://example.org/graphs/publishers>
WHERE {
  ?book rdf:type ex:Book ;
        ex:title ?title ;
        ex:author ?author ;
        ex:publisher ?publisher .
  GRAPH <http://example.org/graphs/authors> {
    ?author ex:name ?authorName .
  }
  GRAPH <http://example.org/graphs/publishers> {
    ?publisher ex:name ?publisherName .
  }
}
```

This query returns books with their titles, author names, and publisher names by combining data from all three graphs.

## GRAPH Keyword: Specifying Patterns in Specific Graphs

The `GRAPH` keyword allows you to specify patterns that should be matched within a specific named graph. We've already seen examples of this in the previous queries. Here's another example:

```sparql
SELECT ?graph ?author ?birthYear
WHERE {
  GRAPH ?graph {
    ?author rdf:type ex:Author ;
            ex:birthYear ?birthYear .
  }
}
```

This query finds all authors and their birth years, along with the graph they're defined in.

## Dropping Graphs: Removing Entire Named Graphs

To remove an entire named graph, you can use the `DROP GRAPH` operation:

```sparql
DROP GRAPH <http://example.org/graphs/reviews>
```

This operation would remove the reviews graph we created earlier.

## Listing Available Named Graphs

To list all available named graphs in the dataset, you can use this query:

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?graph
WHERE {
  GRAPH ?graph { ?s ?p ?o }
}
```

This query returns all named graphs that contain at least one triple.

## Exercise

Now, let's practice what we've learned with a small exercise:

1. Create a new named graph called `<http://example.org/graphs/awards>`.
2. Insert some data into this graph about literary awards won by the books in our dataset.
3. Write a SPARQL query that combines data from the books, authors, and awards graphs to show books, their authors, and any awards they've won.

Here's a starting point for the data insertion:

```sparql
INSERT DATA {
  GRAPH <http://example.org/graphs/awards> {
    ex:book1 ex:award ex:OrwellPrize .
    ex:OrwellPrize ex:name "Orwell Prize" .
    ex:book2 ex:award ex:PulitzerPrize .
    ex:PulitzerPrize ex:name "Pulitzer Prize" .
  }
}
```

Try to write the query yourself before looking at the solution. Good luck!
