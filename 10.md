# 10. SPARQL Update Operations

## Introduction

SPARQL Update Operations are a crucial part of managing RDF data in a triplestore. These operations allow you to modify the data by adding, removing, or updating triples. Understanding and mastering these operations is essential for maintaining and evolving your RDF datasets.

In this lesson, we'll cover various SPARQL Update Operations, including INSERT DATA, DELETE DATA, INSERT/DELETE, DELETE/INSERT, WITH clause, LOAD, and CLEAR. We'll provide examples and explanations for each operation using Apache Jena Fuseki as our SPARQL endpoint.

## Sample RDF Data

Let's start by creating a small RDF dataset about books and authors. We'll use this data throughout our examples.

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

:Book1 rdf:type :Book ;
    :title "The Great Gatsby" ;
    :author :Author1 ;
    :publicationYear "1925"^^xsd:integer .

:Book2 rdf:type :Book ;
    :title "To Kill a Mockingbird" ;
    :author :Author2 ;
    :publicationYear "1960"^^xsd:integer .

:Author1 rdf:type :Author ;
    :name "F. Scott Fitzgerald" .

:Author2 rdf:type :Author ;
    :name "Harper Lee" .
```

To load this data into Apache Jena Fuseki:

1. Save the above Turtle data into a file named `books.ttl`.
2. Open the Fuseki web interface (usually at `http://localhost:3030`).
3. Create a new dataset named "books" if it doesn't exist.
4. Go to the "upload data" tab for the "books" dataset.
5. Choose the `books.ttl` file and upload it.

Now that we have our sample data loaded, let's explore SPARQL Update Operations.

## 1. INSERT DATA: Adding new triples

The INSERT DATA operation allows you to add new triples to the graph.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

INSERT DATA {
  :Book3 a :Book ;
    :title "1984" ;
    :author :Author3 ;
    :publicationYear "1949"^^xsd:integer .
  
  :Author3 a :Author ;
    :name "George Orwell" .
}
```

This query adds information about a new book "1984" and its author "George Orwell" to our dataset.

## 2. DELETE DATA: Removing specific triples

The DELETE DATA operation allows you to remove specific triples from the graph.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>

DELETE DATA {
  :Book2 :publicationYear "1960"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer> .
}
```

This query removes the publication year of "To Kill a Mockingbird" from our dataset.

## 3. INSERT/DELETE: Modifying data based on patterns

The INSERT/DELETE operation allows you to modify data based on patterns. It's useful when you want to update existing data.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

DELETE {
  :Book2 :publicationYear ?year .
}
INSERT {
  :Book2 :publicationYear "1960"^^xsd:integer .
}
WHERE {
  :Book2 :publicationYear ?year .
}
```

This query updates the publication year of "To Kill a Mockingbird" to 1960, regardless of its previous value.

## 4. DELETE/INSERT: Atomic delete and insert operations

The DELETE/INSERT operation is similar to INSERT/DELETE, but it performs the delete operation before the insert operation atomically.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>

DELETE {
  :Author1 :name "F. Scott Fitzgerald" .
}
INSERT {
  :Author1 :name "Francis Scott Fitzgerald" .
}
WHERE {
  :Author1 :name "F. Scott Fitzgerald" .
}
```

This query updates the name of the author "F. Scott Fitzgerald" to "Francis Scott Fitzgerald".

## 5. WITH clause: Specifying the graph to update

The WITH clause allows you to specify which named graph you want to update. This is useful when working with multiple graphs in a dataset.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>

WITH <http://example.org/books-graph>
DELETE {
  :Book1 :publicationYear ?year .
}
INSERT {
  :Book1 :publicationYear "1925"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer> .
}
WHERE {
  :Book1 :publicationYear ?year .
}
```

This query updates the publication year of "The Great Gatsby" in the specified graph named "http://example.org/books-graph".

## 6. LOAD: Importing RDF data into a graph

The LOAD operation allows you to import RDF data from an external source into a graph.

```sparql
LOAD <http://example.org/more-books.ttl> INTO GRAPH <http://example.org/books-graph>
```

This query loads RDF data from the file "more-books.ttl" into the graph named "http://example.org/books-graph".

## 7. CLEAR: Removing all triples from a graph

The CLEAR operation allows you to remove all triples from a specified graph or the default graph.

```sparql
CLEAR GRAPH <http://example.org/books-graph>
```

This query removes all triples from the graph named "http://example.org/books-graph".

## Exercise

Now that we've covered various SPARQL Update Operations, let's practice with a small exercise:

1. Add a new book "Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley, published in 1932.
2. Update the publication year of "1984" to 1948 (the correct year).
3. Remove the author "Harper Lee" from the dataset.
4. Add a new property ":genre" to "The Great Gatsby" with the value "Novel".

Try to write the SPARQL Update queries for these operations. You can test them in the Fuseki web interface.

Here's a hint for the first operation:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

INSERT DATA {
  :Book4 a :Book ;
    :title "Brave New World" ;
    :author :Author4 ;
    :publicationYear "1932"^^xsd:integer .
  
  :Author4 a :Author ;
    :name "Aldous Huxley" .
}
```

Good luck, and remember to check your results after each operation!
