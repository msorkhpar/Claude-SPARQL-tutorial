# 5. Advanced Query Patterns in SPARQL

In this lesson, we'll explore advanced query patterns in SPARQL that allow for more complex and flexible querying of RDF
data. These patterns are essential for handling real-world scenarios where data may be incomplete, diverse, or require 
sophisticated filtering and combination techniques.

## Introduction

Advanced query patterns in SPARQL provide powerful tools for querying RDF data in more nuanced ways. They allow us to
handle missing information, combine results from different patterns, exclude specific patterns, create nested queries,
and perform complex joins. Understanding these patterns is crucial for writing efficient and effective SPARQL queries
for complex data scenarios.

## Sample RDF Data

Let's start by loading some sample RDF data into Apache Jena Fuseki. We'll use a dataset about books and authors.

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/books/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

:book1 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "The Great Gatsby" ;
       :author :author1 ;
       :publicationYear "1925"^^xsd:integer .

:book2 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "To Kill a Mockingbird" ;
       :author :author2 ;
       :publicationYear "1960"^^xsd:integer .

:book3 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "1984" ;
       :author :author3 .

:book4 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "The Catcher in the Rye" ;
       :publicationYear "1951"^^xsd:integer .

:author1 rdf:type :Author ;
         :name "F. Scott Fitzgerald" ;
         :birthYear "1896"^^xsd:integer .

:author2 rdf:type :Author ;
         :name "Harper Lee" .

:author3 rdf:type :Author ;
         :name "George Orwell" ;
         :birthYear "1903"^^xsd:integer .
```

To load this data into Apache Jena Fuseki:

1. Save the above Turtle data into a file named `books.ttl`.
2. In the Fuseki web interface, create a new dataset (if not already created).
3. Go to the "upload data" tab.
4. Select the `books.ttl` file and upload it to your dataset.

Now, let's explore the advanced query patterns using this dataset.

## OPTIONAL Clause: Handling Missing Information

The OPTIONAL clause allows us to include information in our query results that may not be present for all resources.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>

SELECT ?book ?title ?year
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book ;
        :title ?title .
  OPTIONAL { ?book :publicationYear ?year }
}
```

This query retrieves all books with their titles and publication years if available. The OPTIONAL clause ensures that
books without a publication year (like "1984" in our dataset) are still included in the results.

## UNION: Combining Results from Different Patterns

The UNION keyword allows us to combine results from different graph patterns.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>

SELECT ?person ?name ?info
WHERE {
  { ?person a :Author ;
            :name ?name .
    OPTIONAL { ?person :birthYear ?info }
  }
  UNION
  { ?person a :Book ;
            :title ?name .
    OPTIONAL { ?person :publicationYear ?info }
  }
}
```

This query combines information about authors and books, returning their names/titles and birth/publication years if
available.

## MINUS: Excluding Specific Patterns from Results

The MINUS keyword allows us to exclude certain results based on a pattern.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>

SELECT ?book ?title
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book ;
        :title ?title .
  MINUS { ?book :publicationYear ?year }
}
```

This query returns books that don't have a publication year specified.

## Subqueries: Nesting SELECT Statements

Subqueries allow us to nest one SELECT statement inside another.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>

SELECT ?author ?name (COUNT(?book) AS ?bookCount)
WHERE {
  ?author a :Author ;
          :name ?name .
  {
    SELECT ?author (COUNT(?book) AS ?bookCount)
    WHERE {
      ?book a :Book ;
            :author ?author .
    }
    GROUP BY ?author
  }
}
```

This query counts the number of books for each author using a subquery.

## FILTER EXISTS and FILTER NOT EXISTS

These filters allow us to check for the existence (or non-existence) of a pattern without binding its variables.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>

SELECT ?book ?title
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book ;
        :title ?title .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?book :author ?author }
}
```

This query returns books that don't have an author specified.

## Combining Patterns (Implicit Joins in SPARQL)

### Joining on Variables

SPARQL allows for implicit joins by using the same variable in different triple patterns.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>

SELECT ?book ?title ?authorName
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book ;
        :title ?title ;
        :author ?author .
  ?author :name ?authorName .
}
```

This query joins book and author information based on the shared ?author variable.

### Multi-triple Patterns

Complex queries often involve multiple triple patterns to express relationships between different entities.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>

SELECT ?book ?title ?authorName ?year
WHERE {
  ?book a :Book ;
        :title ?title ;
        :author ?author ;
        :publicationYear ?year .
  ?author :name ?authorName ;
          :birthYear ?birthYear .
  FILTER (?year - ?birthYear < 30)
}
```

This query finds books written by authors when they were under 30 years old.

## Exercise

Write a SPARQL query that:
1. Retrieves all books and their authors (if available).
2. Includes the publication year for books published after 1950.
3. Excludes any books written by authors born before 1900.
4. Orders the results by the book title.

Use the advanced query patterns we've discussed in this lesson to construct your query.

This exercise will help you practice using OPTIONAL, FILTER NOT EXISTS, and combining multiple patterns in a single
query.

By mastering these advanced query patterns, you'll be able to write more sophisticated and flexible SPARQL 
queries, allowing you to extract precisely the information you need from complex RDF datasets.
