# 17. Exploring and Managing Graph Schemas in SPARQL

## Introduction

Graph schemas in RDF and SPARQL play a crucial role in organizing and understanding the structure of your data. They define the types of entities, their properties, and relationships within your knowledge graph. Exploring and managing these schemas effectively is essential for maintaining data quality, ensuring consistency, and facilitating efficient querying and data integration.

In this lesson, we'll dive into various aspects of working with graph schemas in SPARQL, including discovering existing schema elements, querying the schema, automating schema creation, refactoring, maintaining consistency, and versioning.

## Sample RDF Data

Let's start by loading some sample RDF data into our Apache Jena Fuseki triplestore. This data will represent a simple library catalog system.

```turtle
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix ex: <http://example.org/library/> .

ex:Book a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Book" ;
    rdfs:comment "A written or printed work consisting of pages glued or sewn together along one side and bound in covers." .

ex:Author a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Author" ;
    rdfs:comment "A person who writes books, stories, or articles." .

ex:title a rdf:Property ;
    rdfs:label "title" ;
    rdfs:domain ex:Book ;
    rdfs:range xsd:string .

ex:author a rdf:Property ;
    rdfs:label "author" ;
    rdfs:domain ex:Book ;
    rdfs:range ex:Author .

ex:publicationYear a rdf:Property ;
    rdfs:label "publication year" ;
    rdfs:domain ex:Book ;
    rdfs:range xsd:integer .

ex:name a rdf:Property ;
    rdfs:label "name" ;
    rdfs:domain ex:Author ;
    rdfs:range xsd:string .

ex:book1 a ex:Book ;
    ex:title "1984" ;
    ex:author ex:author1 ;
    ex:publicationYear 1949 .

ex:author1 a ex:Author ;
    ex:name "George Orwell" .

ex:book2 a ex:Book ;
    ex:title "To Kill a Mockingbird" ;
    ex:author ex:author2 ;
    ex:publicationYear 1960 .

ex:author2 a ex:Author ;
    ex:name "Harper Lee" .
```

To load this data into Apache Jena Fuseki:

1. Save the above Turtle data to a file named `library.ttl`.
2. Open the Fuseki web interface (usually at `http://localhost:3030`).
3. Create a new dataset named "library" if it doesn't exist.
4. Go to the "upload data" tab for the "library" dataset.
5. Choose the `library.ttl` file and upload it.

Now that we have our sample data loaded, let's explore various aspects of managing graph schemas.

## 1. Discovering Types and Predicates in the Graph

To explore the types and predicates in our graph, we can use SPARQL queries to retrieve this information.

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?type ?label
WHERE {
  ?s a ?type .
  OPTIONAL { ?type rdfs:label ?label }
}
```

This query will return all distinct types (classes) used in our graph, along with their labels if available.

To discover predicates:

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT DISTINCT ?predicate ?label
WHERE {
  ?s ?predicate ?o .
  OPTIONAL { ?predicate rdfs:label ?label }
}
```

This query will return all distinct predicates used in our graph, along with their labels if available.

## 2. Querying the Schema: Classes, Properties, and Their Relationships

To explore the relationships between classes and properties, we can use more complex SPARQL queries:

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?class ?property ?propertyLabel ?range
WHERE {
  ?property rdfs:domain ?class ;
            rdfs:label ?propertyLabel ;
            rdfs:range ?range .
}
```

This query will return classes, their properties, property labels, and the range of each property.

## 3. Automating Class and Property Creation with SPARQL INSERT

We can use SPARQL INSERT statements to automate the creation of new classes and properties. Here's an example of adding a new "Publisher" class and a "publisher" property:

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/library/>

INSERT DATA {
  ex:Publisher a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Publisher" ;
    rdfs:comment "An organization that prepares and issues books, journals, or other works for sale." .

  ex:publisher a rdf:Property ;
    rdfs:label "publisher" ;
    rdfs:domain ex:Book ;
    rdfs:range ex:Publisher .
}
```

## 4. Refactoring Entities and Properties

Refactoring involves modifying the structure of your schema. For example, let's say we want to change the "publicationYear" property to a more general "publicationDate" property:

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/library/>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

# Add new property
INSERT DATA {
  ex:publicationDate a rdf:Property ;
    rdfs:label "publication date" ;
    rdfs:domain ex:Book ;
    rdfs:range xsd:date .
}

# Update existing data
DELETE {
  ?book ex:publicationYear ?year .
}
INSERT {
  ?book ex:publicationDate ?date .
}
WHERE {
  ?book ex:publicationYear ?year .
  BIND(CONCAT(STR(?year), "-01-01"^^xsd:date) AS ?date)
}

# Remove old property
DELETE WHERE {
  ex:publicationYear ?p ?o .
}
```

## 5. Maintaining Schema Consistency

To maintain schema consistency, you can create SPARQL queries that check for inconsistencies or violations of your schema rules. For example:

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/library/>

SELECT ?subject ?predicate ?object
WHERE {
  ?subject ?predicate ?object .
  ?predicate rdfs:domain ?domain .
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?subject a ?domain }
}
```

This query will find triples where the subject doesn't match the expected domain of the predicate.

## 6. Versioning RDF Schemas

Versioning RDF schemas can be achieved by using named graphs or by adding version information to your schema elements. Here's an example of adding version information:

```sparql
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/library/>

INSERT DATA {
  ex:LibrarySchema a owl:Ontology ;
    owl:versionInfo "1.1" ;
    rdfs:comment "Library catalog schema, version 1.1" .

  ex:Book owl:versionInfo "1.1" .
  ex:Author owl:versionInfo "1.0" .
  ex:Publisher owl:versionInfo "1.0" .
}
```

This adds version information to the overall schema and individual classes.

## Exercise

1. Create a new class called "Genre" and a property "genre" that relates books to genres.
2. Write a SPARQL query to find all books that don't have an associated genre.
3. Create a SPARQL query to check if there are any authors in the dataset that are not associated with any books.

These exercises will help you practice creating new schema elements, querying for data consistency, and exploring relationships between entities in your graph.

By mastering these techniques for exploring and managing graph schemas, you'll be better equipped to maintain high-quality, consistent RDF data and create more effective SPARQL queries.
