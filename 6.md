# 6. Working with RDF Data Types and Literals

## Introduction

In SPARQL, working with RDF data types and literals is crucial for effective querying and data manipulation. This lesson
covers various operations and functions that allow you to work with strings, numbers, dates, and perform type 
conversions. These operations are essential for filtering, transforming, and analyzing RDF data in your SPARQL queries.

## Sample RDF Data

Let's start by creating a sample RDF dataset that we'll use throughout this lesson. We'll use a small library catalog
as our example.

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/library/> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

:book1 a :Book ;
    :title "The Great Gatsby" ;
    :author "F. Scott Fitzgerald" ;
    :publicationDate "1925-04-10"^^xsd:date ;
    :pageCount 180 ;
    :price 12.99 .

:book2 a :Book ;
    :title "To Kill a Mockingbird" ;
    :author "Harper Lee" ;
    :publicationDate "1960-07-11"^^xsd:date ;
    :pageCount 281 ;
    :price 14.99 .

:book3 a :Book ;
    :title "1984" ;
    :author "George Orwell" ;
    :publicationDate "1949-06-08"^^xsd:date ;
    :pageCount 328 ;
    :price 11.99 .

:book4 a :Book ;
    :title "Pride and Prejudice" ;
    :author "Jane Austen" ;
    :publicationDate "1813-01-28"^^xsd:date ;
    :pageCount 432 ;
    :price 9.99 .
```

## Loading Data into Apache Jena Fuseki

To load this data into Apache Jena Fuseki:

1. Save the above RDF data in a file named `library.ttl`.
2. Open the Fuseki web interface (usually at `http://localhost:3030`).
3. Create a new dataset named "library" if it doesn't exist.
4. Go to the "upload data" tab for the "library" dataset.
5. Choose the `library.ttl` file and upload it.

## String Operations

SPARQL provides several string operations that allow you to manipulate and filter string literals.

### STRENDS, STRSTARTS, CONTAINS

These functions check if a string ends with, starts with, or contains another string, respectively.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/library/>

SELECT ?title
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title .
  FILTER(STRENDS(?title, "Gatsby"))
}
```

This query will return "The Great Gatsby" because it's the only title that ends with "Gatsby".

```sparql
SELECT ?title
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title .
  FILTER(STRSTARTS(?title, "To"))
}
```

This query will return "To Kill a Mockingbird" because it's the only title that starts with "To".

```sparql
SELECT ?title
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title .
  FILTER(CONTAINS(?title, "and"))
}
```

This query will return "Pride and Prejudice" because it's the only title that contains "and".

### REGEX

The REGEX function allows for more complex string matching using regular expressions.

```sparql
SELECT ?title
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title .
  FILTER(REGEX(?title, "^The|^To", "i"))
}
```

This query will return titles that start with either "The" or "To", case-insensitive. It will return "The Great Gatsby"
and "To Kill a Mockingbird".

## Numeric Operations

SPARQL provides functions for performing calculations on numeric values.

### SUM, ROUND, FLOOR, CEIL

```sparql
SELECT (SUM(?price) AS ?totalPrice) (ROUND(AVG(?price)) AS ?averagePrice)
WHERE {
  ?book :price ?price .
}
```

This query calculates the total price of all books and the rounded average price.

```sparql
SELECT ?title ?price (FLOOR(?price) AS ?floorPrice) (CEIL(?price) AS ?ceilPrice)
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title ;
        :price ?price .
}
```

This query shows the floor and ceiling values for each book's price.

## Date and Time Functions

SPARQL has functions for working with date and time values.

### NOW, YEAR, MONTH, DAY

```sparql
SELECT ?title ?publicationDate (YEAR(?publicationDate) AS ?year) 
       (MONTH(?publicationDate) AS ?month) (DAY(?publicationDate) AS ?day)
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title ;
        :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
```

This query extracts the year, month, and day from each book's publication date.

```sparql
SELECT ?title (YEAR(NOW()) - YEAR(?publicationDate) AS ?age)
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title ;
        :publicationDate ?publicationDate .
}
ORDER BY DESC(?age)
```

This query calculates the age of each book in years, ordered from oldest to newest.

## Type Conversion Functions

SPARQL provides functions for converting between different data types.

### STR, DATATYPE, LANG

```sparql
SELECT ?title (STR(?price) AS ?priceString) (DATATYPE(?price) AS ?priceDatatype)
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title ;
        :price ?price .
}
```

This query converts the price to a string and shows its datatype.

```sparql
SELECT ?title ?price
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title ;
        :price ?price .
  FILTER(xsd:decimal(?price) < 12.00)
}
```

This query filters books with a price less than 12.00, explicitly converting the price to a decimal.

## Exercise

Write a SPARQL query that does the following:

1. Selects books published before the year 1950
2. Calculates how many years ago they were published (rounded to the nearest year)
3. Shows the book title in uppercase
4. Shows the price rounded to the nearest dollar
5. Orders the results by publication date (oldest first)

Try writing this query yourself before looking at the solution below.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/library/>
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

SELECT ?title (ROUND(YEAR(NOW()) - YEAR(?publicationDate)) AS ?yearsAgo) 
       (UCASE(?title) AS ?upperTitle) (ROUND(?price) AS ?roundedPrice)
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title ;
        :publicationDate ?publicationDate ;
        :price ?price .
  FILTER(YEAR(?publicationDate) < 1950)
}
ORDER BY ?publicationDate
```

This query should return information about "The Great Gatsby" and "1984", as they were published before 1950.

operations, numeric calculations, date and time functions, and type conversions. Practice using these functions in your
queries to become more proficient in manipulating and analyzing RDF data.
