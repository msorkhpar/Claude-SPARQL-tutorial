# 15. Advanced SPARQL Features

In this lesson, we'll explore advanced SPARQL features that allow for more complex and flexible querying of RDF data. These features are essential for handling real-world data scenarios and creating sophisticated queries.

## Introduction

Advanced SPARQL features provide powerful tools for data manipulation, conditional logic, and complex filtering. These features allow you to write more expressive queries, handle missing data, and perform complex data transformations. Understanding these concepts is crucial for working with diverse datasets and solving complex querying problems.

## Sample RDF Data

Let's start by creating a sample RDF dataset about books and authors. We'll use this data to demonstrate the advanced SPARQL features.

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/books/> .
@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

:book1 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "The Great Gatsby" ;
       :author :author1 ;
       :publicationYear "1925"^^xsd:integer ;
       :price 12.99 .

:book2 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "To Kill a Mockingbird" ;
       :author :author2 ;
       :publicationYear "1960"^^xsd:integer ;
       :price 14.99 .

:book3 rdf:type :Book ;
       :title "1984" ;
       :author :author3 ;
       :publicationYear "1949"^^xsd:integer .

:author1 rdf:type :Author ;
         :name "F. Scott Fitzgerald" ;
         :birthYear "1896"^^xsd:integer .

:author2 rdf:type :Author ;
         :name "Harper Lee" ;
         :birthYear "1926"^^xsd:integer .

:author3 rdf:type :Author ;
         :name "George Orwell" ;
         :birthYear "1903"^^xsd:integer .
```

## Loading Data into Apache Jena Fuseki

To load this data into Apache Jena Fuseki:

1. Save the above RDF data in a file named `books.ttl`.
2. Open the Fuseki web interface (usually at `http://localhost:3030`).
3. Create a new dataset named "books" if it doesn't exist.
4. Go to the "upload data" tab for the "books" dataset.
5. Choose the `books.ttl` file and upload it.

## Advanced SPARQL Features

### 1. Binding Variables: BIND and VALUES Clauses

#### BIND Clause

The `BIND` clause allows you to assign a value to a variable within a query.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>
SELECT ?book ?title ?price ?discountedPrice
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title ;
        :price ?price .
  BIND (?price * 0.9 AS ?discountedPrice)
}
```

This query retrieves books with their titles and prices, and calculates a discounted price (10% off) using the `BIND` clause.

#### VALUES Clause

The `VALUES` clause allows you to introduce inline data into a query.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>
SELECT ?author ?name ?book
WHERE {
  VALUES ?author { :author1 :author2 }
  ?author :name ?name .
  OPTIONAL { ?book :author ?author }
}
```

This query uses `VALUES` to specify two authors and retrieves their names and associated books.

### 2. Conditional Expressions: IF, COALESCE, IFNULL

#### IF Expression

The `IF` function allows for conditional logic within a query.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>
SELECT ?book ?title ?price ?priceCategory
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title ;
        :price ?price .
  BIND (IF(?price > 13, "Expensive", "Affordable") AS ?priceCategory)
}
```

This query categorizes books as "Expensive" or "Affordable" based on their price.

#### COALESCE Function

`COALESCE` returns the first non-null value from a list of expressions.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>
SELECT ?book ?title (COALESCE(?price, "Not for sale") AS ?displayPrice)
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title .
  OPTIONAL { ?book :price ?price }
}
```

This query uses `COALESCE` to display "Not for sale" for books without a price.

### 3. Transposing Data with OPTIONAL

The `OPTIONAL` keyword allows for left outer joins in SPARQL.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>
SELECT ?book ?title ?price
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title .
  OPTIONAL { ?book :price ?price }
}
```

This query retrieves all books and their prices, including books without a price.

### 4. Negation in SPARQL: Combining OPTIONAL and FILTER

Negation can be achieved by combining `OPTIONAL` and `FILTER`.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>
SELECT ?book ?title
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title .
  OPTIONAL { ?book :price ?price }
  FILTER (!BOUND(?price))
}
```

This query finds books that don't have a price specified.

### 5. Complex Filtering: Subqueries in FILTER Clauses

Subqueries within `FILTER` clauses allow for more complex filtering conditions.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>
SELECT ?book ?title ?author ?authorName
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title ;
        :author ?author .
  ?author :name ?authorName .
  FILTER EXISTS {
    SELECT ?author
    WHERE {
      ?author :birthYear ?birthYear .
      FILTER (?birthYear < 1900)
    }
  }
}
```

This query finds books written by authors born before 1900.

### 6. Assigning and Using Query Variables

You can assign values to variables and use them throughout the query.

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/books/>
SELECT ?book ?title ?author ?authorName ?age
WHERE {
  ?book :title ?title ;
        :author ?author ;
        :publicationYear ?pubYear .
  ?author :name ?authorName ;
          :birthYear ?birthYear .
  LET (?age := ?pubYear - ?birthYear)
  FILTER (?age < 40)
}
```

This query calculates the age of the author at the time of book publication and filters for books written by authors under 40.

## Exercise

Create a SPARQL query that does the following:

1. Retrieves all books and their authors.
2. Calculates the number of years between the author's birth and the book's publication.
3. Categorizes this time difference as "Early Career" (less than 30 years), "Mid Career" (30-50 years), or "Late Career" (over 50 years).
4. Orders the results by the author's name.

Use the `BIND`, `IF`, and ordering features in your query.

## Conclusion

These advanced SPARQL features provide powerful tools for querying and manipulating RDF data. They allow for complex data transformations, conditional logic, and sophisticated filtering, enabling you to extract precise and meaningful information from your datasets. Practice using these features to become proficient in crafting complex SPARQL queries for real-world scenarios.
